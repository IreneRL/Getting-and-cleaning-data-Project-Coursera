Getting and cleaning data - Week4_final project
Assignment:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. See object: “test_train_set”.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. See object: “test_train_mean_std”
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. See object: “test_train_set”.
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. See object: “test_train_set”.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. See object: “Average_test_train”

The steps followed to address this assignment are explained in the attached README file.
Variables and objects used or generated in the R script, as well as output file, are specified below:

VARIABLES
subject: id obtained from subject_test and subject_train
activity: activity numbers obtained from y_test and y_train and transformed to names as coded in “activity_labels” table.
“Mean_ …”: 66 variables in  Average_test_train (after subject and activity): created to indicare the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from “test_train_mean_std”
561 variable names in the x_test and x_train data sets are obtained from the data frame “features”
dataSet: in test_train_set , belongs to “test” or “train” data sets.
.
OBJECTS:
fileUrl: "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
features: read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt"): variable names for x_test and x_train
activity_labels: read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
x_test: read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
subject_test: read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", col.names = "subject")
test_labels: read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt",col.names = "activity")
x_train: read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")
subject_train: read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", col.names = "subject")
train_labels: read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt",col.names = "activity")
test_labelswnames: vector with descriptive activity labels for x_test data set.
train_labelswnames: vector with descriptive activity labels for x_train data set.
testDataSet: assembled data frame with “subject” column,”activity” column and all the variables specified in “features” with their values for x_test
trainDataSet: assembled data frame with “subject” column,”activity” column and all the variables specified in “features” with their values for x_train
test_train_set <- merged from “testDataSet” and “trainDataSet”
test_train_mean_std: subject,activity,dataSet,contains("mean()"),contains("std()")): Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (Requirement 2 assignment)
Average_test_train: independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (Requirement 5).

OUTPUT
“Average_test_train.txt” file is generated in the working directory.
